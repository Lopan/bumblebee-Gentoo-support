Hi :)

this is my FIRST INSTALL EVER so please excuse me if I did some mistakes in it.

PLEASE READ INSTALL FILES VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE APPLYING CHANGES TO YOUR MACHINE.

I am still can't get it to work properly, might be (and almost certainly it is :) ) because I did mistakes.
Any help, contribution is appreciated.

I am using ASUS N61Jv laptop and running gentoo for AMD64 platform so did not worked on x86 install yet.

To make everything install I unpacked "VirtualGL_amd64.deb" and arranged/renamed all files like if they were
already on place and place them into "files" dir in install, that way it was easier to me to track which
files goes where, so expect to see files sorted in folders like ${LAYMAN_BUMBLEBEE_DIR}/files/etc,
${LAYMAN_BUMBLEBEE_DIR}/files/opt, etc. :), tried to left everything as author intended it to be.

Layman_files folder contains all I did to make layman see/work with my ebuild.

INSTALLATION:
Here is what could be done to install this ebuild.
You need to copy info from "layman_files/insert_into_cache.xml" to "/var/lib/layman/cache_***.xml" file.
That will make possible to do next
sudo layman -a(--add) bumblebee
from your terminal.

! ATTENTION ! :
I did not yet set up configuring mechanism for selecting compress mode or monitor connection mode in ebuild.
They are hard coded in ebuild to my own configuration (N61JV CRT-0 and XV).
So if you have troubles with launching it, please correct those values for your own configuration.
In nearest feauture I will fix that issue, but for now it is bug that I don't know how to fix.

For future plans:
Of course run and test.
maybe create another ebuild for VirtualGL_amd64.deb (if it doesn't exist already).
x86 install

Good luck.

Cheers,
Iegor
