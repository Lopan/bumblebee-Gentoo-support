# If we have upgraded the daemon since we last started it, we can't use the
# --exec argument to start-stop-daemon, because the daemon's inode will have
# changed. The risk here is that in a situation where the daemon died, its
# pidfile was not cleaned up, we've upgraded it, *and* some other process is now
# running under that pid, start-stop-daemon will send signals to an innocent
# process. However, this seems like a corner case. C'est la vie!
# Update: --name should prevent signalling innocent processes.
