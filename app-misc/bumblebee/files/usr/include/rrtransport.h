              use this handle to send the 3D pixels to the 2D X server using
              X11 functions, if it so desires.
   win (IN) = a handle to the X window into which the application intends the
              3D pixels to be rendered.  The plugin can use this handle to
              deliver the 3D pixels into the window using X11 functions, if it

   Connect to a remote image receiver

   PARAMETERS:

   receiver_name (IN) = character string containing the name of the receiver
                        to which to connect.  This is typically the TCP/IP
                        address or hostname of the client machine, but this
                        parameter may be used for other purposes as well.
                        VirtualGL sets this parameter to the value of the
                        VGL_CLIENT environment variable or, if VGL_CLIENT is
                        unset, to the display string of the 2D X server.
   port (IN) = the receiver port to which to connect.  This is typically
               the TCP port on which the receiver is listening, but this
               parameter may be used for other purposes as well.  VirtualGL
               sets this parameter to the value of the "port" variable in the
               faker configuration structure.  See the User's Guide for more
               information on how that variable is set.

   RETURN VALUE:
   This function returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.  RRTransGetError() can

   PARAMETERS:
   handle (IN) = instance handle (returned from a previous call to
                 RRTransInit())
   width, height (IN) = dimensions of frame buffer to be allocated by the
                        transport plugin
   format (IN) = the pixel format that VirtualGL believes will produce the
                 most optimal readback performance.  This will always
                 correspond to the "native" pixel format of the Pbuffer.  When
                 PBO readback mode is enabled, then the plugin must return a
                 frame with this pixel format, or VirtualGL will automatically
                 fall back to using synchronous readback mode for this frame.
   stereo (IN) = 1 to request a stereo frame or 0 to request a mono frame

   RETURN VALUE:
   If a buffer is successfully allocated, then a non-NULL pointer to an RRFrame
   structure is returned (see above for a description of this structure.)
   Otherwise, NULL is returned and the reason for the failure can be queried
   with RRTransGetError().
